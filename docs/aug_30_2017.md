# Start of Something New

This is the start of my Dev blog. I want to learn new things and the best way to know if you learned something for sure
is to talk about it. What I want to accomplish is to try and write this weekly. I am thinking every Sunday morning. 
In it I will talk about what I have done in that past week and what I have learned.

##It will be okay if 

* I miss a day.
* Don't do any work that week 

The whole purpose it to learn something at my own pace. **It is not a race it is a marathon.** 

I will be able to get more use out of markdown and be able to see how far I came. Employers will like to hear about his 
it should be positive overall. Just don't freak out about this and get anxious. 
This is for fun and to learn.
